"""
This script analyzes commit data from a CSV file and visualizes the contributions of different authors
over time in terms of the number of weeks since the project's creation date.

General Logic Flow:
1. Read commit data from a CSV file ('data/commits_rootbeer.csv').
2. Extract file names, authors, and commit dates from the CSV data.
3. Generate unique colors for each author to differentiate them in the plot.
4. Map file names to unique numbers for efficient plotting.
5. Convert commit dates to datetime objects and calculate the number of weeks since the project's creation.
6. Organize commit data by author, associating files and weeks with each author.
7. Plot the contributions of each author over time using a scatter plot.
8. Display a legend showing the mapping of authors to colors.
